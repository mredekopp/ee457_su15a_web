##Discussion
Discussion will be used to introduce lab and review important concepts from lecture.  Be sure to attend.

###Discussion 1 - Modelsim & Tool Setup / Verilog Review
- ModelSim Installation -- See [EE 457 DEN site](https://courses.uscden.net/d2l/home)
    - Follow the instructions on the EE 457 DEN site under the *Lab Setup* module. You will need the username/password credentials on that site to download Modelsim.
    - If you do not have access to a PC, you should consider one of the options below:
        1. Use a Virtual machine image installed on the campus PC userrooms (SAL, WPH, etc.)
            - Login
            - Open the Virtual Machines folder in Programs menu and clicking on the shortcut in the Programs menu labeled XP32-201108-PUVVADA.
            - A window opens with a Windows-XP Desktop. You can invoke Modelsim from there. 
        1. Use the Unix installation.  Follow [these instructions](http://www-classes.usc.edu/engr/ee-s/457/ee457_Verilog/ee457_unix_modelsim_setup_and_testing.pdf)

- [Testing Modelsim Install]({{site.url}}/docs/EE457_ModelSim_PE_Testing_USC.pdf)
    - You may need these files. Download them only if you can't find them during the testing process
        - [middle_finder.do](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/middle_finder.do)
        - [middle_find_wave.do](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/middle_finder.do)
       
- [Verilog Review](http://ee.usc.edu/%7Eredekopp/ee457/slides/EE457Unit1b_VerilogDiscussion.pdf)

###Discussion 2 - Lab 1 (Min/Max Finder)

Read the [lab 1 handout](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/ee457_min_max_finder_lab.pdf)

**In teams of 2:**
- Complete all 6 state diagrams
- Complete the Verilog implementation and testing for only Part 1, Part 3 Method 1, Part 3 and Method 3

**Individually**
- Answer Questions 1 and 2 ( *answers should be unique for every individual...don't work in groups* )


The skeleton implementation files are located here:

- [Part 1](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/min_max_finder_part1.zip) 
- [Part 3 M1](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/min_max_finder_part3_M1.zip) 
- [Part 3 M3](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/min_max_finder_part3_M3.zip) 

If you are working on your Unix account you can extract the files and then FTP them to your aludra account via  FileZilla or other SFTP tool available from USC.

**We will post submission instructions shortly...check back here soon**
