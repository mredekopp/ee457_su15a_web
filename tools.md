### Modelsim Setup

The main software tool we will use for labs and homeworks in this class is Mentor Graphics Modelsim, an HDL simulator.
 
#### Install Modelsim SE and 5 other tools 
Follow these [instructions](http://www-classes.usc.edu/engr/ee-s/457/ee457_tools/EE457_README_first.pdf)

If you have Modelsim (SE/DE) installed on your PC and is working fine already, you do not have to install the Modelsim SE again. It does not matter for our course what modelsim tool version you are running.

Important:  To access Modelsim installation files, the linked document below says you should use your USC username and 10-digit ID.  That is no longer necessary.  Simply use the following username and student ID:

username:   ttrojan 
student ID: 1010101010

Also install 5 other minor tools described in these [instructions](http://www-classes.usc.edu/engr/ee-s/457/ee457_tools/EE457_README_first.pdf)

#### Using Unix Modelsim Setup [Option to use USC servers]
Please run this setup...Note will need the two .do files linked below to run the full demo project.

Some of the students have Macs and hence are not able to install the ModelSim SE .

You have another two options. 

1. Use the Modelsim on the university UNIX system by logging into one of the scf servers aludra or nunki.

It is quick and easy and you can use your Mac or PC from your home.

The procedure is narrated [at this link](
http://www-classes.usc.edu/engr/ee-s/457/ee457_Verilog/ee457_unix_modelsim_setup_and_testing.pdf)

1. You can go to the SAL125 user-room and login on one of the Macs.
Then open the Virtual Machines folder in Programs menu and clicking on 
the shortcut in the Programs menu labeled XP32-201108-PUVVADA.
A window opens with a Windows-XP Desktop. You can invoke Modelsim from there.
