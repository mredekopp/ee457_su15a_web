### Modelsim Setup

The main software tool we will use for labs and homeworks in this class is Mentor Graphics Modelsim, an HDL simulator.
 
#### Install Modelsim SE and 
If you have Modelsim (SE/DE) installed on your PC and is working fine already, you do not have to install the Modelsim SE again. It does not matter for our course what modelsim tool version you are running. 

If you need to install Modelsim on your own PC follow the instructions for [installing ModelSim 10.4a]( {{site.url}}/docs/ModelSim_SE_10_2_Installation_by_USC_students.pdf) (the document references 10.2, but please change all such references to 10.4a).

** EXTREMELY IMPORTANT **

To download Modelsim you will need a specific username and password (NOT your USC ID/password).  Please log-in to the EE 457 DEN course and go to the Lab Setup module to find those credentials.

#### Install 5 other tools 

Also install 5 other minor tools described in these [instructions](http://www-classes.usc.edu/engr/ee-s/457/ee457_tools/EE457_README_first.pdf)

#### Using Unix Modelsim Setup [Option to use USC servers]
Please run this setup...Note will need the two .do files linked below to run the full demo project.

Some of the students have Macs and hence are not able to install the ModelSim SE .

You have another two options. 

1. Use the Modelsim on the university UNIX system by logging into one of the scf servers aludra or nunki.

It is quick and easy and you can use your Mac or PC from your home.

The procedure is narrated [at this link](
http://www-classes.usc.edu/engr/ee-s/457/ee457_Verilog/ee457_unix_modelsim_setup_and_testing.pdf)

1. You can go to the SAL125 user-room and login on one of the Macs.
Then open the Virtual Machines folder in Programs menu and clicking on 
the shortcut in the Programs menu labeled XP32-201108-PUVVADA.
A window opens with a Windows-XP Desktop. You can invoke Modelsim from there.
