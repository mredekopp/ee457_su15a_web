## Lab 1

**Due Fri. 6/5 at 11:59 PM (PST)**
 
Read the [lab 1 handout](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/ee457_min_max_finder_lab.pdf)

**In teams of 2:**
- Complete all 6 state diagrams
- Complete the Verilog implementation and testing for only Part 1, Part 3 Method 1, Part 3 and Method 3

**Individually**
- Answer Questions 1 and 2 ( *answers should be unique for every individual...don't work in groups* )


The skeleton implementation files are located here:

- [Part 1](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/min_max_finder_part1.zip) 
- [Part 3 M1](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/min_max_finder_part3_M1.zip) 
- [Part 3 M3](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/min_max_finder_part3_M3.zip) 

If you are working on your Unix account you can extract the files and then FTP them to your aludra account via  FileZilla or other SFTP tool available from USC.

Submit your code as a SINGLE .ZIP file (not .bz2, not .gz, not .tar) but zip.  You can do an Internet search to see about how to create a zip file from the command line or with 3rd party tools like 7-Zip.  Your zip file should be named `lab1.zip` and contain:

- min_max_finder_part1.v 
- output_results_part1.txt 
- min_max_finder_part3_M1.v 
- output_results_part3_M1.txt
- min_max_finder_part3_M3.v 
- output_results_part3_M3.txt
- names.txt  (should contain the name of you and your lab partner).

Each individual should submit their .zip file on the **[EE 457 DEN Desire2Learn site](https://courses.uscden.net/d2l) in the Lab 1 dropbox.
