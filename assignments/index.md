##Assignments
Homework will be assigned roughly once per week. It will be graded, and require substantial work. The average student should expect to spend about 15 hours per homework. Homeworks will typically contain a mix of programming exercises and "theory" questions about data structures and their implementation. Roughly every third homework will contain a piece that contributes toward the class project, which is to build a simpler version of Netflix from scratch. As the project progresses, students may find it necessary to revisit and improve their earlier solutions, so good coding practices and documentation are strongly encouraged.

For detailed information on late submission policies, grace periods, and similar questions about assignments, check the [syllabus](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/Syllabus.pdf).
