## Lab 2

**Due Fri. 6/12 at 11:59 PM (PST)**

### Handout 
Read the [lab 2 handout](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/ee457_fifo.pdf)

### Procedure
**Individually, NO TEAMS**

- Download the [skeleton files, testbench, and .do file](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/ee457_fifo.zip)
   + `ee457_fifo.v` contains a skeleton of the FIFO design. Do not modify the port interfaces but feel free to add additional internal signal declarations and your behavioral/RTL description.
   + `ee457_fifo_tb.v` contains a complete testbench to test **SOME** cases but is definitely **NOT** a definitive test that ensures your FIFO has 0 bugs.

- Complete Parts 1 and 2 designing, simulating, and verifying the two FIFO design alternatives.  Note that you should ensure your design works for various depths.
- Answer the review questions in a file `review.txt`

### Submission

Submit your two fifo implementations and testbench(es) (if you made additional testbenches, please include them) as a SINGLE .ZIP file (not .bz2, not .gz, not .tar but zip).  You can do an Internet search to see about how to create a zip file from the command line or with 3rd party tools like 7-Zip.  Your zip file should be named `lab1.zip` and contain:

- ee457_fifo.v
- ee457_fifo_p2.v
- ee457_fifo_tb.v
- review.txt (answers to the review problems) 

Submit their .zip file on the **[EE 457 DEN Desire2Learn site](https://courses.uscden.net/d2l)** in the **Lab 2 dropbox** under the **Lab Submission Folder/Section**.
